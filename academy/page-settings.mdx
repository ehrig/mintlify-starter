## One Page Navigation

If enabled, Bricks adds a vertical dot menu to the right edge of the page in a fixed position, with each dot linking to the page's root element.

**Note**: A unique CSS ID is required for root elements (sections, etc.) for One Page Navigation to work. If the root element is within a query loop, you can assign a CSS ID using dynamic tags like post\_id or post\_slug. (assumed it's a post loop)
