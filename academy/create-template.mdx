Now that you are familiar with all [template concepts](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/an-intro-to-templates/) and the [template library](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/template-library/) let's create the most commonly used templates: a website header, footer, and blog post layout in the video below.

Bricks, by default, shows your first published header and footer template on your website. You can disable this behavior from your WordPress dashboard under **Bricks → Settings → Templates** by selecting the **Disable Default Templates** setting.

With default templates disabled you need to manually set Template Conditions when editing your template under **Settings → Template Settings → Template Conditions**.

The following video will walk you through the entire process:

## Header Template Settings

When editing a header template, an additional **Header** settings group is available under **Settings → Template Settings **→** Header**.

There you can find various header-specific settings such as:

- Header position (top/right/left)
- Header width (available when header position is set to left/right)
- Sticky header (available when header position is set to top)

### Disable Header On Specific Page

To disable the header on a specific Page, go to **Settings → Page Settings → General** and check **Disable Header**. Useful for landing/splash pages.

### Disable Footer On Specific Page

To disable the footer on a specific Page, edit this page and go to **Settings → Page Settings → General** and check **Disable Footer**. Useful for landing/splash pages.
