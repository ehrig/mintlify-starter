The Block element is one of the four [layout elements](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/layout/) in Bricks (1.5+).

Introduced together with the [Section](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/section-element/) & [Div](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/div-element/) element it allows you to create flexible layouts in record time.

It offers the same controls as the [Container](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/container-element/) element (flexbox, query loop, etc.). But uses a default width of 100%.

This makes it the perfect element to use inside of a Container (e.g. column/row based layout). Or wherever you need to span the entire available width, plus quick access to direction & alignment settings. As the Block element uses `flex` by default.

If want your layout element to only take up the space of its content, use the [Div](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/div-element/) element instead.
