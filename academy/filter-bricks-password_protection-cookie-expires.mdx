Adjust the expiration time for the password cookie used by [the password protection template](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/password-protection/). By default, when a password is set in the template settings, the cookie expires after **10 days**. This filter allows you to customize how long the cookie remains valid.

## **Example Usage:**

```php
add_filter( 'bricks/password_protection/cookie_expires', function( $expire ) {
    // Set cookie expiration to 1 hour (3600 seconds)
    return time() + 3600;
} );
```

In this example, the password cookie will expire after 1 hour, requiring users to re-enter the password if they revisit the page after that time.

**Parameters:**

- `$expire` (int): The default expiration timestamp for the password cookie, which is set to **10 days**.

**Return:**

- (int): The Unix timestamp for when the cookie should expire.
