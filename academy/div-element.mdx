The Div element is one of the four [layout elements](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/layout/) in Bricks (1.5+).

Introduced together with the [Section](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/section-element/) & [Block](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/div-element/) element it allows you to create flexible layouts in record time.

The Div element in Bricks is a plain, unstyled div. It's the most generic element to group and lay out your content.

While you use the **Container** to "contain" other elements inside a preset width of 1100px, and the **Block** element with a 100% width, the **Div** element has no presets at all.

Making it perfect to use inside other layout elements as it grows & shrinks according to its content, or to build Div-only class-based layouts.
