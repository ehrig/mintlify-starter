Please do not edit any of the Bricks theme core files directly, as updating the theme will cause all your changes to be lost. 

Instead, use the Bricks child theme to make modifications and overwrite files. You can download the Bricks child theme directly from your [Bricks account](https://my.bricksbuilder.io/).

Upload this child theme ZIP file (bricks-child.zip) like any other WordPress theme. Go to **Appearance → Themes** and activate **Bricks Child Theme**. You can add your own styles to **style.css**.

## How To Enqueue Scripts (JS) & Styles (CSS)

In order to load your files only on the front end & the canvas and not in the builder panel (as your custom CSS might affect the builder), you have to check against `bricks_is_builder_main()` like this:

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', function() {
  // Code & check below enqueues your files on the canvas & frontend, not the builder panel. Otherwise custom CSS might affect builder)
  if ( ! bricks_is_builder_main() ) {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'bricks-child', get_stylesheet_uri(), ['bricks-frontend'], filemtime( get_stylesheet_directory() . '/style.css' ) );
  }
} );
```

You can learn more about how a Child Theme works by visiting the official WordPress Codex: [https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/)

The `functions.php` file of a child theme, unlike `style.css`, does not override the `functions.php` file of the parent theme. Instead, it is loaded in addition to the parent theme's `functions.php`, right before the parent file.
