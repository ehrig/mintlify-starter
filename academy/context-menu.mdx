Bricks' context menu gives you quick access to various block actions such as edit, clone, delete, copy & paste styles (works also across different browser tabs), and to save elements as [Global Elements](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/global-elements/).

To reveal the context menu simply hover over any block on the canvas and perform a right-click.
