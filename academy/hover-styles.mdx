The "Hover Styles" button as outlined below is now outdated. It has been replaced by a fully customizable pseudo-class & pseudo-element menu in Bricks 1.3.5: [Styling Element States & Parts](https://academy.bricksbuilder.io/article/pseudo-classes/)

Bring your site to life and boost visitor engagement by styling the hover state of any block.

Activate the **Hover Styles** mode by clicking the "cursor" icon in the builder toolbar. The icon should now be highlighted, indicating that you are editing not the default state, but the mouseover/hover styles.

You can now start editing any style of any block that you'd like to add hover effects for.

Once done, leave the hover styles mode by clicking the "cursor" icon in the builder toolbar again. Then switch to Preview Mode (CMD/CTRL + P) to see your changes in action by hovering over the block(s) you just styled.
