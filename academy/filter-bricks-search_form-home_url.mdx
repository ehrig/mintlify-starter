The `bricks/search_form/home_url` filter allows developers to customize the action URL of the search form within the Bricks theme. This filter provides the flexibility to redirect search queries to a different URL than the default WordPress home URL.

By using this filter, developers can integrate custom search solutions or direct the search form submissions to a specific page, enhancing the search functionality tailored to specific needs.

### Example Usage:

```php
add_filter( 'bricks/search_form/home_url', function( $home_url ) {    // Custom logic to determine the action URL    $custom_action_url = 'https://example.com/custom-search-page/'; 
    return $custom_action_url;});
```

In this simple example, the search form action URL is changed to a custom page. This is particularly useful for websites with specialized search requirements or for integrating with external search platforms.

### Parameters:

- `$home_url` (string): The default URL to which the search form points, typically the home URL.

### Return:

- (string): The modified URL for the search form action.
